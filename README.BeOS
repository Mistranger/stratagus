libpng and libz (the .so versions, not the .a that come with BeOS):

To compile FreeCraft for BeOS, you can either use 'setup' like normal people
(but the executable produced can't run from the Tracker) or you can use
BeIDE... BeIDE is the prefered method.

And the simplest. Copy FreeCraft-beos.proj from contrib to the top level
directory of FreeCraft. Just start it, open the FreeCraft-beos.proj file, and
"Make" it (Alt-M). That's it.

Now you have a working copy of FreeCraft, thats all there is to it.

    <H2>Software Requirements</H2>

You need:
<UL>
	<LI>Operating systems:
	<UL>
	<LI>Linux System with an installed X Windows System.
	<LI>Linux System with console (graphic card) supported by svgalib.
	<LI>Any BSD System with an installed X Windows System.
	<LI>Maybe any other Unix/POSIX OS with X Windows System installed.
	    You may have to create the configuration by hand and install additional non-common
	    libraries and gcc (untested).
	<LI>BeOS System with an installed X Windows System.
	<LI>MacOS System with an installed X Windows System.
	<LI>X Window System with 8/15/16/24/32bit X Server.
	<LI>Win32 system win95, win98, winME, winNT or win2000.
	    <UL>
		<LI>For network play WIN95 OSR2 (aka win95b) or higher is required
                    since some features of winsock2.dll are used. We try to emulate
		    this using wsock32.dll features, but that code is not in yet.
		<LI>winNT mean winNT4.0 (most like + service pack 3) or higher for
		    the same reasons.
	    </UL>
	</UL>
	<LI>libpng. (I use libpng-2.1.0, aka 1.0.5)
	<LI>zlib. (Also needed for libpng, I use libz-1.1.3)
	<LI>SIOD. (Included in the distribution)
	<LI>The original game CD or expansion CD for manuals and maindat.war
	    for graphics and sfxdat.sud for sounds.
	    <br>Or use the free replacements from the freecraft graphics and sounds projects.
</UL>
These are optional:
<UL>
	<LI>libpthread. (For threaded sound support)
	<LI>SVGALib	(for console support)
	<LI>SDL		(Additional SDK support)
</UL>

    <H2>Hardware Requirements</H2>

<UL>
	<LI>At least an i586 133 Mhz (faster recommended) and 16 MB Ram.
	<LI>Any graphic-card with 15/16bit videomode running with X11 or 
	    SVGALib or Win32.
</UL>

    <H2>Installation</H2>

    <H3>Unix or BSD</H3>
<A NAME="unix-src"></A>

Please follow the following instruction to get a working program.
<UL>
	<LI>Unpack the archive freecraft-'data'.tar.gz to any directory.
	    (stored <B>with</B> path)
	<LI>Change to the toplevel directory (cd freecraft-'date').

	<LI>You own the original:
	<UL>
	<LI>Search the files maindat.war, sfxdat.sud,strdat.war  and rezdat.war
	    from the original game.
	    <B>This version supports the original or expansion CD!</B>
	    If you have only the original CD, it should also works, ignore the
	    warnings.
	<LI>Edit tools/build.sh, and change ARCHIVE to the correct path.
	    (You could use an installed version or the CD-ROM)
	    Extract from "/cdrom" is the default. Just mount your cd to /cdrom.
	</UL>
	<LI>With the graphic from the FreeCraft Graphic Project:
	<UL>
	<LI>Get the correct fcraft (graphic) and scraft (sound) archives.
	<LI>Download fcraft from <A HREF="http://fgp.cjb.net">FGP</A>
	<LI>Download scraft from <A HREF="http://FreeCraft.org">FreeCraft</A>
	<LI>Extract them.
	</UL>
	<LI>Copy Rules.make.orig to Rules.make and edit it or run the setup
	    script.
 	<LI>Type "./setup" to configure the graphics, sound, and compression
	    options.
	    <UL>
	    <LI>"./setup --help" shows a list of available setup options
	    <LI>You have the option of running "make" from the script,
		bypassing the next step.
	    </UL>
  	<LI>If you have the original type "make buildit" or
	    ". tools/build.sh", to extract and convert the needed graphics,
	    sounds and puds. (You need to run this only once!)
 	<LI>Now it's time for a coffee break.
  	<LI>Type "make". (Should compile without errors :-)
	<LI>Optional:
	    <UL>
	    <LI>Edit "data/ccl/freecraft.ccl" to configure FreeCraft
		with SIOD support.
	</UL>
	<LI>Now you could start with "./freecraft".
	<LI>That's all, I hope you have enjoyed the game.
	<LI>If you find any bug, look in
		<A HREF="todo.html">todo.html</A>
	    if it is already known, if not please mail it to
	    <A HREF="mailto:aleclone@FreeCraft.org">The FreeCraft Project</A>.
	<LI>ADVANCED: Type "make help" for more compile options.
	<P>
	<LI>If you get killed everytime by the computer, let the ai sleep with
		the command line option "-s n" (sleep n frames) or set the build
	costs and build times of the computer with -f 110 and -t 110 higher.
</UL>

    <H2>SVGALib support = console</H2>

<P>Make sure that you have installed the SVGALib development kit.  The setup
script should take care of the rest.

    <H2>SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) support</H2>

    <H2>Prepare network play</H2>

You can play FreeCraft in the network or twice on the same computer.  Install
it on all computers with the above instructions. 
You can now start it on each computer with:

<H3>You need a server</H3>

freecraft -p [players] [map]<BR>
freecraft -p 2 ./data/puds/multi/3vs3.pud.gz

<P>The game waits until all players are connected. Press ALT-'q' to quit the
game.

<H3>You need the clients</H3>

freecraft -n [server] [map]<BR>
freecraft -n localhost ./data/puds/multi/3vs3.pud.gz

game server. The map must be the same on all computers.

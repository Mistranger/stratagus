    <H2>What is FreeCraft?</H2>

    FreeCraft is a free cross-platform real-time strategy gaming engine.
    It is possible to play against human opponents over LAN, internet, or
    against the computer. The engine can be used to build C&amp;C, WC2, SC and
    AOE-like real-time strategy (RTS) games. It successfully runs under Linux,
    BSD, BeOS, MacOS/X, MacOS/Darwin and MS Windows.
    <P>
    Since the FreeCraft engine doesn't provide graphics, sounds and
    documentation, you'd need the <B>original game</B> so FreeCraft can
    extract the necessary files. The BNE version is currently not supported,
    you must own the old DOS version. (With over 1 million sold copies this
    shouldn't be a big problem)
    <P>
    Alternatively you can download the free media (sounds and graphics) from
    the FreeCraft Media Project:<BR>

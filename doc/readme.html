    <H2>What is FreeCraft?</H2>

    FreeCraft was formerly known as ALE Clone.<P>
    It is a clone of the real-time fantasy strategy game W*rCr*ft II.<BR>
    FreeCraft is platform independent and runs currently under UNIX or LINUX
    or BSD or BeOS or MacOS with X11 or console or any Win32 (Win95, Win98,
    WinME, WinNT, Win2000).
    <P>
    FreeCraft is distributed under the <A HREF="gpl.html">GNU General Public
    License </A>, only version 2!
    <P>
    Since FreeCraft doesn't provide graphics, sounds and documentation,<BR>
    you need the <B>original game</B> so FreeCraft can extract the necessary
    files.<BR>
    The BNE version is currently not supported, you must own the old DOS
    version.<BR>
    (With over 1 million sold copies this shouldn't be a big problem)<P>
    Alternative you could download free media (sounds and graphics) from the:
    <BR><A HREF="http://FreeCraft.Net/fcmp/">

    <H2>What is FreeCraft?</H2>

    FreeCraft was formerly known as ALE Clone.<P>
    A clone of the real-time fantasy strategy game W*rCr*ft II.<BR>
    FreeCraft is platform independent and runs currently under UNIX or LINUX
    or BSD or BeOS or MacOS with X11 or console or any Win32 (Win95,Win98,
    WinME,WinNT,Win2000).
    <P>

    Since FreeCraft doesn't provide graphics, sounds and documentation,<BR>
    you need the <B>original game</B> so FreeCraft can extract the necessary
    files. (With over 1 million sold copies this shouldn't be a big problem)<P>
    Alternative you could download the free graphic from the:<BR>

<H2>Intro - Introduction to CCL - Craft Configuration Language</H2>

FreeCraft should become sometimes a real-time strategy engine. To define
the different games a configuration language is needed.<BR>
I have choosen scheme, because it is easy to parse and produce good readable
config files.<P>

<H2>Help</H2>

Like everything in this project, I need here also help. Nothing is fixed,
the complete syntax of all this functions could be changed, rewritten if
wanted. This are only my suggestions, to have something to start with.

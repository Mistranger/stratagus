    <h2>What is FreeCraft?</h2>

    FreeCraft is a free cross-platform real-time strategy gaming engine.
    It is possible to play against human opponents over LAN, internet, or
    against the computer. The engine can be used to build C&amp;C, WC2, SC and
    AOE-like real-time strategy (RTS) games. It successfully runs under Linux,
    BSD, BeOS, MacOS/X, MacOS/Darwin and MS Windows.

<h1>Stratagus Palette Documentation</h1>
<hr>

<h2>General Palette</h2>

Stratagus graphics use a 256 color palette. Although the palette may 
be different for all images, it is recommended to use a shared one 
to save memory.<p>

To see color indices, open the 'Indexed Palette' dialog in gimp.<p>

Some colors are fixed for specific usage as follows:<p>

<ul>
    <li>0 : General background color, will be transparent in the game.
    <li>38-47 : Water Cycling.
    <li>240-244 : Icon Cycling.
    <li>205-207 : Building Cycling.
    <li>208-211 : These are the player colors, going from lightest to 
    darkest and will be replaced depending on the player color.
    <li>253 : Reserved for editor, should NOT be used in any image.
    <li>255 : General background color, will be transparent in the game.
    <li>The remaining colors may be used as regular colors
</ul>

NOTE: the cycling applies to all images, eg, the building cycling 
occurs for icons as well. The color cycling can be configured 
from ccl eg, by editing the "(set-color-water-cycle-start! 38)" line 
you can set the start for the water cycling.<p>

<h2>Global Palette</h2>

The tileset palette is used as a general palette for purposes 
such as line-drawing. The following color indices are used in 
addition to the fixed colors described above and 
should be taken into account when creating a tileset:<p>

<ul>
    <li>0 : Black
    <li>149 : Dark Green
    <li>206 : Blue
    <li>246 : White
    <li>247 : NPC
    <li>248 : Gray
    <li>249 : Red
    <li>250 : Green
    <li>251 : Yellow
    <li>252 : Blinking Red
    <li>253 : Violet
</ul>

A sample palette, <a href="stratagus.gimp">stratagus.gimp</a>,

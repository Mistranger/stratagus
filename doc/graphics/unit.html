<li>Building for land resource. (mine)

<h2>Needed graphics for the units</h2>

To an unit/building/object belongs an icon and some animations.<p>
Each unit/building/object has its portrait, which could be different for
each tileset.<p>
And following animations:
<ul>
<li>Standing
<li>Moving
<li>Attacking
<li>Dieing
<li>Under construction
<li>In use
</ul>

<h2>The icon format</h2>

An icon has the size of 46x38 pixels. Currently all icons are stored in a
single file (I will change this, if required).<p>

<h2>Unit file format</h2>

All images for all animations and headings are stored in an single file.
Currently the loader supports only <i>PNG</i> format.
The biggest needed size is taken for all images.
<p>

[1-1][1-2][1-3][1-4][1-5]<br>
[2-1][2-2][2-3][2-4][2-5]<br>
....<br>
[n-1][n-2][n-3][n-4][n-5]<br>

<p>X-1 ... X-5 are the different headings for the same animations.
<ul>
<li>X-1 looking north
<li>X-2 looking north-west
<li>X-3 looking west
<li>X-4 looking south-west
<li>X-5 looking south
<li>The missing directions are made with mirroring
</ul>

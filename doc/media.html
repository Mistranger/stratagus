<h1>FreeCraft 1.18 Media Documentation</h1>
<hr>

    <h2>Graphics<

    <h2>Sounds</h2>

    Any format of sound will work with FreeCraft, although to save space it is 
    recommended that you use 16 bit, 22050 kHz, mono format. To save more 
    space, it is recommended that you gzip the file too.<p>

    All the sound entry data is in data/ccl/sound.ccl, 
    Here is an example ccl entry for: data/sounds/human/buildings/farm.wav.gz<p>

    <pre>(make-sound "farm-selected" "human/buildings/farm.wav")</pre><p>

    Note how the '.gz' suffix isn't needed in the ccl entry, 
    the FreeCraft engine detects this automatically.<p>

    You may look through the ccl file for more examples.<p>

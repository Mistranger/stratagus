<H2> This should be done for the next release (1.19):</H2>
<!-- ---- ====== -- ---- --- --- ---- ------- ------- -->
<UL>
<LI>Worker with gold/wood could go to depot under construction!
<LI>Ai can't find any way, tries this to often.
<LI>Decoration on top not supported.
<LI>Regenerating forest looks weird.
<LI>Touch of darkness has wrong time for damage.
<LI>SVGALIB version does not support 3 mouse button.
<LI>Sometime it seems that the command buttons aren't changed.
<LI>Let target of attack command blink, if selected (like right click)
<LI>Should rewrite the create player code.
<LI>Should show planed buildings, if I build with alt+shift more than one.
<LI>Canceled buildings stills shows gray rectangle, if new building is build.
<LI>New show actions produces new errors, buttons aren't correctly updated.
<LI>The color cycling isn't 100% correct. See FIXME: in ColorCycle()
<LI>Scroll with the keyboard: use state and not the repeat rate. Than make
    the scroll speed configurable. Use the repeat flag for faster scrolling.
<LI>Ships do not go up and down, if attacking.
<LI>I cannot change unit 'pending' or however you call it (command applied to
    new trained units) when there is a unit in train queue, I think I could.
<LI>A peon can enter a mine and die in the mine.
<LI>A peon can enter a deposit and die in the deposits.
<LI>The thing is, if whatever is blocking the path to the wood moves, the
    worker moves to some wired position (-1,-1), if no hall is available.
<LI>First sound of attack i never hear, only second,..
<LI>4map of orc campaign - I can't get option for creation of transport
    (can't upgrade townhall)
<LI>Let single player maps played as multiplayer.
<LI>More suggestions?
<LI>Building-cursor and cursor over units shouldn't change to looking glass.
<LI>Flying and ships could only be on even fields.
<LI>The heading of attacking units isn't 100% correct. 
<LI>The heading of missiles isn't 100% correct.
<LI>Units trained says nothing?
<LI>Fix all known core dumpers.
<LI>Ships should first attack units with distance weapon.
<LI>Units attacked, which can't re-attack should go out of range.
</UL>

<H2> Next to implement: </H2>
<!-- ==== == ========== -->
<UL>
<LI>Document all functions with doc++ or doxygen comments.
<LI>Show the units in a transporter on map. (Partly done)
<LI>New spell "show units in enemy transporters"
<LI>Make a spy unit.
<LI>Costs Spells
<LI>Corpse have a sight-range which will slowly reduced.
<LI>Reduce memory use. (16 MB)
<LI>Unit moves away from magni.., glass must disappear. (duplicate)
<LI>The price and name of something to be built/upgraded doesn't disappear,
    and will remain on the screen until another price comes up.
<LI>The brown background is never updated, and it will build a mass of
    strange bits of pictures.
<LI>Water buildings couldn't be always be reached with new ship code.
<LI>Selecting with rectangle and scrolling with keyboard: some solutions??
<LI>Transporter and party didn't meet automatic (fixed, but not perfect)!
<LI>Another big thing I noticed - When loading data/puds/multi/jimland.pud,
    before the player stats appear, MANY lines saying "REGM:  contains unknown
    action 0x4100" are shown.  I didn't even look to see where this message is
    generated, but this serves as a heads-up.
<LI>Status line isn't correct cleared.
<LI>Make color-cycling speed configurable.
<LI>ActionNone is used, where?
<LI>Support different AI for levels.
<LI>Let the campaigns play like the original.
<LI>Setting the units limit for each player separate.
</UL>

<H2>In the near future:</H2>
<!-- == === ==== ======= -->
<UL>
<LI>Computer AI should be improved
<LI>Add map-specific AI strategies
<LI>Fog of war (correct)
<LI>Exploration (correct)
<LI>Never chop the same wood twice.
<LI>DGA X11 supported.
<LI>individual speeds for players.
<LI>Training queues without resources.
<LI>Hear range, and sound handling of only bearable sounds.
</UL>

<H2>In the far future:</H2>
<!-- == === === ======= -->
<UL>
<LI>Documentation
<LI>Support for debian / rpm packets (Yes: on www.debian.org or www.suse.de)
</UL>

<H2>Future plans:</H2>
<!-- ====== ====== -->
<UL>
<LI>Editing Way-points
<LI>Editing Build multiple units (training queue)
<LI>Editing Build list for buildings (building queue)
<LI>Z coordinates
<LI>Ground effects (roads faster,...)
<LI>Animated cursors
<LI>Automatic repairs
<LI>Show how time of bloodlust... (blink if short before end)
<LI>Show invisible better, (transparent...)
<LI>Radar minimap. (Edgar!)
<LI>Map zoom factor 1,2,4 like anno 1602
<LI>Add support for SHM-Extensions without pixmap support
</UL>

<H2>New ideas:</H2>
<!-- === ====== -->
<UL>
<LI>Animated resource icons.
<LI>All icons animated.
<LI>Paladins: Autohealing + Autoexorcism
<LI>Ogres: Autobloodlust
<LI>Upgradeable magic: One level of upgrade == -(10-15)% required mana to cast,
    but +(15-20)% of cost. Up to level 9.
<LI>Upgradeable weapon accuracy: In the same manner as upgradeable magic,
    damage 4-12 --&gt; 5-12 --&gt; ... --&gt; 12-12. ballistas/ships accuracy
    increases in step of 5. accuracy improvements enabled after full strength
    upgrades.
<LI>Units can patrol between other units.
<LI>Mage Tower/Temple of Death accumulates energy. Then it can be transferred
    to nearby units in x8 value.
<LI>What about if peon attack is modified in this way that if attacks
    building it returns 1/2 of the resources for it. something like demolishing,
    not needed buildings or enemy ones.
<LI>Support for W*rC*rft. (without II)
<LI>Support for W*rC*rft Alpha. (Some nice ideas was dropped)
<LI>Allow multiple tilesets / map or pud.
<LI>1) Randomly generate unit structure. Random health, mana, accuracy.
<LI>2) Allow bridges over rivers, that can be destroyed.
<LI>3) Allow true stone walls - make a big castle that can be defended
    archers on stone walls, just mages can destroy stonewall, ballist can
    break gateway into the castle. How ever some war vehicles can overcome
    stonewall - something like ladders.
<LI>4) Allow attack and defend formation:

<PRE>
        x              x x x x x    
       x x              x x x x
      x   x            x x x x x
     x     x            x x x x
</PRE>

   and many others, that will be kept while moving. Also 'disperse' command,
   i.e. while attacked by catapults.
<LI>5) Allow retreat command, all units that are in fighting area will retreat.
   Or selected units immediately do retreat.
<LI>6) Allow army structures, select i.e. 9 footmen mark as a column, select 9 
   columns mark as something other and so on till you select whole army.
<LI>7) Do it a little bit real. You do not have to kill all enemies but achieve
   some line and make your enemy to retreat.
<LI>8) Mage can teleport a unit to another place. Mage could cast spells to
    multiple units, not just to one.
<LI>Walls with different Hitpoints.
<LI>Scrolling/Zooming the minimap.
<LI>Day and night cycles.
<LI>Line of sight, shows only viewing direction
<LI>Line of sight, to be blocked by big objects. (Ground levels...)
<LI>More critters, and critter that attack, critter that give 
    birth to other critters, critters which are invisible in forest 
    but show up in land, critters which are ridable, the give birth 
    idea could be used as a way to have extinction in those big 1000 x 
    1000 maps :)
<LI>Add barks.
<LI>Now we just have to add plant-trees command to peons
<LI>Make critters attacking all player units.
</UL>
<H2>New units/behavior:</H2>
<!--=== ===== ========= -->
<UL>
<LI>Critters
    <UL>
    <LI> Cost only time ( no food required )
    <LI> Every few ( 3-5 ) critters provide food for few units ( 1-2? )
    </UL>
<LI>Dark Portal -- teleport, portal between worlds
    <UL>
    <LI> Requires Castle,Church and MageTower to build ( perhaps and some
         Mages trained? )
    <LI> Collects mana
    <LI> Uses full mana load to place teleport destination
    <LI> Teleport units with mana cost
    <LI> `Recall's unit from the destination spot back ( mana cost )
    <LI> Can be upgraded to allow to summon other worlds units ( daemons )
    </UL>
<LI>Runestone
    <UL>
    <LI> Requires Castle,Church and MageTower to build ( build by peon,
         activate by mage? )
    <LI> Collects mana
    <LI> Transfers (auto?) mana to all magic units in the range
         ( Mages,Paladins )
    <LI> Even can transfer mana to other buildings like Dark Portal!
         ( So Dark Portals can be supported by cluster of runestones... )
    <LI> Heal all units in the range ( requires mana )
    <LI> Blocks all Dark Portal destination spots in the range
    </UL>
</UL>

<LI>Let target of attack command blink, if selected (like right click)
<LI>gryphon rider attack animation could trigger oops (internal error).
<LI>Wood counter should be reseted, avoiding evil tricks.

</UL>

<H2> This must be done for the release (1.18):</H2>

<UL>

<LI>my unit cannot attack enemy building when it is not finished yet (building)

    worker will stay locked up.
<LI>Building tower I start see in it range before it completed

</UL>

<H2>In the far future:</H2>
<!-- == === === ======= -->
<UL>
<LI>Documentation
<LI>Background sound support
<LI>Support for debian / rpm packets
</UL>

<H2>Future plans:</H2>
<!-- ====== ====== -->
<UL>
<LI>Editing Way-points
<LI>Editing Build multiple units (training queue)
<LI>Editing Build list for buildings (building queue)
<LI>Z coordinates
<LI>Ground effects (roads faster,...)
<LI>800x600 resolution support ( requres just 800x600 mode border/interface graphics )

</UL>

<H2>New ideas:</H2>
<!-- === ====== -->
<UL>
<LI>Animated resource icons.
<LI>All icons animated.
<LI>Paladins: Autohealing + Autoexorcism
<LI>Ogres: Autobloodlust
<LI>Upgradable magic: One level of upgrade == -(10-15)% required mana to cast,
                  but +(15-20)% of cost. Up to level 9.
<LI>Upgradable weapon accuracy: In the same manner as upgradable magic,
    damage 4-12 --> 5-12 --> ... --> 12-12. ballistas/ships accuracy increases
    in step of 5. accuracy improvements enabled after full strength upgrades.
<LI>Count kills for unit/building.
<LI>Food requires/food provides for units.
<LI>Units can patrol between other units.
<LI>Mage Tower/Temple of Death accumulates energy. Then it can be transferred
    to nearby units in x8 value.
<LI>What about if peon attack is modified in this way that if attacks
    bulding it returns 1/2 of the resources for it. something like demolishing,
    not needed buldings or enemy ones.
<LI>Support for W*rC*rft. (without II)
<LI>Support for W*rC*rft Alpha. (Some nice ideas was dropped)
<LI>Allow multiple tilesets / map or pud.
<LI>1) Randomly generate unit structure. Random health, mana, accuracy.
<LI>2) Allow bridges over rivers, that can be destroyed.
<LI>3) Allow true stonewalls - make a big castle that can be defended
   archers on stonewalls, just mages can destroy stonewall, ballist can
   break gateway into the castle. How ever some war vehicles can overcome
   stonewall - somethink like ladders.
<LI>4) Allow attack and defend formation:

<PRE>
        x              x x x x x    
       x x              x x x x
      x   x            x x x x x
     x     x            x x x x
</PRE>

   and many others, that will be kept while moving. Also 'disperse' command,
   i.e. while attacked by catapults.
<LI>5) Allow retreat command, all units that are in fighting area will reatreat.
   Or selected units immediately do retreat.
<LI>6) Allow army structures, select i.e. 9 footmen mark as a column, select 9 
   columns mark as something other and so on till you select whole army.
<LI>7) Do it a little bit real. You do not have to kill all enemies but achieve
   some line and make your enemy to retreat.
<LI>8) Mage can teleport a unit to another place. Mage could cast spells to
    multiple units, not just to one.
<LI>Walls with different Hitpoints.
<LI>Use or control MP3 music for background.
<LI>Scrolling/Zooming the minimap.
<LI>Day and night cycles.
<LI>Line of sight, shows only viewing direction
<LI>Line of sight, to be blocked by big objects. (Ground levels...)
<LI>More critters, and critter that attack, critter that give 
    birth to other critters, critters which are invisible in forest 
    but show up in land, critters which are ridable, the give birth 
    idea could be used as a way to have extinction in those big 1000 x 
    1000 maps :)
<LI>Trigger system like St*rCr*ft.
<LI>Add barks.
<LI>Now we just have to add plant-trees command to peons
<LI>Make critters attacking all player units.
</UL>
<H2>New units/behaviour:</H2>
<!--=== ===== ========= -->
<UL>
<LI>Critters
    <UL>
    <LI> Cost only time ( no food requred )

    </UL>

    <LI> Requres Castle,Church and MageTower to build ( perhaps and some

    <LI> Teleport units with mana cost

    <LI> Collects mana
    <LI> Transfers (auto?) mana to all magic units in the range
         ( Mages,Paladins )
    <LI> Even can transfer mana to other buildings like Dark Portal!
         ( So Dark Portals can be supported by cluster of runestones... )
    <LI> Heal all units in the range ( requires mana )

    </UL>

Unit:
=====

    #include "unit.h"
    typedef struct _unit_ Unit;

    This structure contains all informations about an unit in game.
    An unit could be everything, a man, a vehicle, a ship or a building.

The unit structure members:

Unit::Refs
----------
    The reference counter of the unit. If the pointer to the unit is stored
    the counter must be incremented and if this reference is destroyed the
    counter must be decremented. Alternative it would be possible to
    implement a garbage collector for this.

Unit::Slot
----------
    This is the unique slot number. It is not possible that two units have
    the same slot number at the same time. The slot numbers are reused.
    This field could be accessed by UnitNumber(Unit*).
    Maximal 65535 (=MAX_UNIT_SLOTS) simultaneous units are supported.

Unit::UnitSlot
--------------
    This is the pointer into Units[], where the unit pointer is stored.
    Units[] is a table of all units currently active in game.
    This pointer is only needed to speed up, the remove of the unit pointer
    from Units[].

Unit::PlayerSlot
----------------
    A pointer into Player::Units[], where the unit pointer is stored.
    Player::Units[] is a table of all units currently belonging to a player.
    This pointer is only needed to speed up, the remove of the unit pointer
    from Player::Units[].

Unit::Next
----------
    A generic link pointer. This member is currently used, if an unit is on
    the map, to link all units on the same map field together.  This member is
    currently unused, if the unit is removed. (see Unit::Removed)
    F.E.: A worker is removed, if he is in a mine or depot. Or an unit is
    on board a transporter.

Unit::X Unit::Y
------- -------
    The tile map coordinates of the unit. 0,0 is the upper left on the map.

Unit::Type
----------
    Pointer to the unit type (UnitType). The unit type contains all informations
    that all units of the same type shares. (Animations, Name, ...)

Unit::Player
------------
    Pointer to the owner of this unit (Player). An unit could only be owned
    by one player.

Unit::Stats
-----------
    Pointer to the current status (UnitStats) of an unit. The units of the
    same player and the same type could share the same stats. The status
    contains all values which could be different for each player. This
    are f.e. the upgradeable abilities of an unit.  (Unit::Stats::SightRange,
    Unit::Stats::Armor, Unit::Stats::HitPoints, ...)

Unit::IX Unit::IY
-------- --------
    Coordinate displacement in pixels or coordinates inside a tile. Currently
    only !=0, if the unit is moving from one tile to another (0-32).

Unit::Frame
-----------
    Current graphic image of the animation sequence. The high bit (128) is used
    to flip this image horizontal (x direction).

Unit::SeenFrame
---------------
    Graphic image (see Unit::Frame) what the player on this computer has last
    seen. If -1 the player haven't seen this unit.

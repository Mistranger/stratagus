<P>
<DT>Q: I was playing in 800x600 mode, and the graphics around the edge didn't paint the full screen?
<DD>A: The original graphics aren't designed for this resolutions, you could
    design your own user interface, see "data/ccl/ui.ccl".
<P>
<DT>Q: The graphics didn't fit on 800x600 or higher resolution?
<DD>A: The original graphics aren't designed for this resolutions, you could
    design your own user interface, see "data/ccl/ui.ccl".
<P>
<DT>Q: The graphics didn't fit on 800x600 or higher resolution?
<DT>Q: gzseek already defined or undefined!

<DD>A: You have an incompatible libpng version, better you install the latest
libpng1.0.X. You get it here:
    <A HREF="ftp://swrinde.nde.swri.edu/pub/png/">SwRI</A>
<P>
<DT>Q: The software cursor is too slow

<DD>A: I will improve the speed later, but me was told:<BR>
Using Accelerated X on a Pentium 75 FreeCraft is now playable.
<P>
<DT>Q: Why did Guile 1.3 not work?

<DD>A: Applies only to older versions, since october 1998 supported.<P>

Change the line in 'Rules.make':<P>
    GUILELIB=       -lguile -ldl<P>
into<P>
    GUILELIB=       `guile-config link` -lreadline -lncurses<P>
With this I got guile 1.3 working.
<P>
<DT>Q: Did FreeCraft work with ALSA?

<DD>A: Yes, FreeCraft works with the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) - Driver.
I have tested it with version 0.3.2 - 0.4.1.<P>
More informations <A HREF="http://www.alsa-project.org">

<P>
<DT>Q: How did I get big maps?

<DD>A: If you want a map of the size 256 x 256.
Create and edit 4 maps (128 x 128) in the original editor.
Save them as bigmap1.pud, bigmap2.pud, bigmap3.pud and bigmap4.pud.
Now create a file bigmap.cm containing:
<P><PRE>
	(define-map 256 256)
	(load-pud "bigmap1.pud")
	(load-pud "bigmap2.pud")
	(load-pud "bigmap3.pud")
	(load-pud "bigmap4.pud")
</PRE><P>
If you now load this file as map (freecraft bigmap.cm), you see this big map.
bigmap1.pud is in the upper left corner.
bigmap2.pud is in the upper right corner.
bigmap3.pud is in the lower left corner.
bigmap4.pud is in the lower right corner.
<P>
<DT>Q: Can I use the original without expansion?

<DD>A: There are only more graphics and sounds in the expansion CD version.
Me was told, it works without problems with the german version. Just try it.
With the new versions this should work without problems.

<P>
<DT>Q: I get the error message "gcc: No input files", when I build freecraft.
    (Reported with pgcc version 1.1.1.) What should I do?

<DD>A: Try changing the line in the freecraft toplevel Makefile <BR>
        $(CC) -Lsrc -lclone $(CLONELIBS) -o freecraft -I. $(CFLAGS) <BR>
    to <BR>
        $(CC) -Lsrc -lclone $(CLONELIBS) -o freecraft -I. $(CFLAGS) dummy.c <P>
    and execute the command "<I>touch dummy.c</I>" in the freecraft toplevel
    directory. <P>
    Or install a better gcc version without this bug.
<P>
<DT>Q: I have tried to start a level with
    './freecraft data/puds/internal/internal01.pud.gz' and I only get this error
    message
    'pud: fopen,gzopen,bzopen(): No such file or directory'.
<DD>A: We have changed the loading syntax:
    <UL>
    <LI>file.pud loads relative from $CLONE_LIB_PATH (in my source "data").
    <LI>./file.pud loads relative from the current directory.
    <LI>/file.pud loads absolute from the root directory.
    </UL>
    This means you must type './freecraft ./data/puds/internal/internal01.pud.gz'!
<P>
<DT>Q: I got following error messages if I start freecraft from the binary release.
<BR>ERROR: In procedure primitive-load-path:
<BR>ERROR: Unable to find file "ice-9/boot-9.scm" in load path 
<DD>A: Install the runtime system for guile/libguile.
<BR>If you have it already installed or the installation didn't fix this error,
try to use: "GUILE_LOAD_PATH=where_you_have_the_ice-9_directory ./freecraft"
to start.
<P>This sections should be outdated, currently SIOD is used.
<P>
<DT>Q: The mouse react after seconds on my moves?
<DD>A: I didn't found the real problem. Currently use the threaded sound
support and enable it (in data/ccl/sound.ccl) or and add to the line
<P>
DFLAGS= $(THREAD) $(GUILE) $(VERSION) $(GLIB) $(VIDEO) $(ZDEFS) $(DSOUND)
$(DEBUG) -DNEW_VIDEO
<P>
"-DSLOW_INPUT" in Rules.make.

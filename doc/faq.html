    <b>Q: gzseek already defined or undefined.</b><br>
    A: You have an incompatible libpng version, install the latest version.<p>

    <b>Q: The software cursor is too slow.</b><br>
    A: This should be fixed in the latest stable release, if it still happens, 
    compile in SDL video mode or add -DSLOW_INPUT to DFLAGS in Rules.make.<p>

    <b>Q: Does FreeCraft work with ALSA.</b><br>
    A: Yes, if you compiled SDL with alsa support and you compiled freecraft
    using SDL video mode.<p>

    <b>Q: Does FreeCraft work with the W*rcr*ft 2 Expansion CD?</b><br>
    A: Yes.<p>

    <b>Q: Does FreeCraft work with the W*rcr*ft 2 BNE version?</b><br>
    A: No. The file format of this version is currently not supported.<p>

    <b>Q: Can I use FreeCraft to join in a W*rcr*ft 2 network game?</b><br>
    A: Sorry, FreeCraft use its own network protocol. 
    The protocol needs the exact same code executed on all machines, 
    and it is not possible to have this with the original WC2, 
    therefore you can only connect to a FreeCraft server.<p>

    <b>Q: What about other RTS games?</b><br>
    A: St*rcr*ft and W*rcr*ft 1 support is in development. T*ber*an Sun 
    may be added in the distant future. For the old C&C games, you can 
    use freecnc.<p>

    <b>Q: What ports does the FreeCraft network protocol use?</b><br>
    A: 6660 by default, you may start freecraft with '-Pxxxx' flag to 
    use port xxxx instead.<p>

    <b>Q: Does freecraft support internet/metaserver play?</b><br>
    A: Not yet, but this is a planned feature and may be added for 1.19<p>

    <b>Q: I get only a black window after I have installed it on windows.
    What have I done wrong?</b><br>
    A: Install FreeCraft to the C: drive. This has solved the problem for
    everybody who has had this bug.<p>

    <b>Q: I have installed the windows version, when I start FreeCraft I get
    only the splash screen and the game stops, but consumes 100% CPU. What
    have I done wrong?</b><br>
    A: Please wait for a couple of minutes for the game to start. There are
    some machines (Win98 and Win2000) that will still not start after some
    time.  On all machines I have tested it, it works.  I have no idea where
    the problem is, any help is welcome.<p>

    <b>Q: My question isn't answered here.</b><br>
    A: Send an e-mail to our hard working
    <a href="mailto:nehal@canada.com">support</a> team. :)<p>

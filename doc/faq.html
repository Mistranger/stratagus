<P>
<DT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Q: I was playing in 800x600 mode, and the graphics around the edge didn't paint the full screen?</FONT>
<DD>A: The original graphics aren't designed for this resolutions, you could
    design your own user interface, see "data/ccl/ui.ccl".
<P>
<DT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Q: The graphics didn't fit on 800x600 or higher resolution?</FONT>
<DD>A: The original graphics aren't designed for this resolutions, you could
    design your own user interface, see "data/ccl/ui.ccl".
<P>
<DT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Q: I get the error "gzseek already defined or undefined!", what should I do?</FONT>
<DD>A: You have an incompatible libpng version, better you install the latest
libpng1.0.X. You get it here:
    <A HREF="ftp://swrinde.nde.swri.edu/pub/png/">SwRI</A>
<P>
<DT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Q: The software cursor is too slow, how can I get it quicker?</FONT>

<DD>A: I will improve the speed later, but I was told:<BR>
Using Accelerated X on a Pentium 75 FreeCraft is now playable.
<P>
<DT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Q: Did FreeCraft work with ALSA?</FONT>

<DD>A: Yes, FreeCraft works with the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) - Driver.
I have tested it with version 0.3.2 - 0.9.0.<P>
More informations <A HREF="http://www.alsa-project.org">

<P>
<DT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Q: How did I get big maps?</FONT>

<DD>A: If you want a map of the size 256 x 256.
Create and edit 4 maps (128 x 128) in the original editor.
Save them as bigmap1.pud, bigmap2.pud, bigmap3.pud and bigmap4.pud.
Now create a file bigmap.cm containing:
<P><PRE>
	(define-map 256 256)
	(load-pud "bigmap1.pud")
	(load-pud "bigmap2.pud")
	(load-pud "bigmap3.pud")
	(load-pud "bigmap4.pud")
</PRE><P>
If you now load this file as map (freecraft bigmap.cm), you see this big map.
bigmap1.pud is in the upper left corner.
bigmap2.pud is in the upper right corner.
bigmap3.pud is in the lower left corner.
bigmap4.pud is in the lower right corner.
<P>
CraftED - The FreeCraft map editor, also supports the creation of big maps.
<P>
<DT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Q: Can I use the original without expansion?</FONT>

<DD>A: There are only more graphics and sounds in the expansion CD version.
Me was told, it works without problems with the german version. Just try it.
With the new versions this should work without problems.

<P>
<DT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Q: I have tried to start a level with
    './freecraft data/puds/internal/internal01.pud.gz' and I only get this
    error message 'pud: fopen,gzopen,bzopen(): No such file or directory'.
    What do I wrong?
    </FONT>
<DD>A: We have changed the loading syntax:
    <UL>
    <LI>file.pud loads relative from $CLONE_LIB_PATH (in my source "data").
    <LI>./file.pud loads relative from the current directory.
    <LI>/file.pud loads absolute from the root directory.
    </UL>
    This means you must type './freecraft ./data/puds/internal/internal01.pud.gz'!
<P>
<DT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">
    Q: Why did the mouse react after seconds on my moves?</FONT>
<DD>A: I didn't found the real problem. Currently use the threaded sound
    support and enable it (in data/ccl/sound.ccl) or and add to the line
<P>
DFLAGS= $(THREAD) $(CCL) $(VERSION) $(VIDEO) $(ZDEFS) $(DSOUND) \
	$(DEBUG)
<P>
"-DSLOW_INPUT" in Rules.make.
<P>
<DT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Q: I want play but do not want use CD...  can i copy files from cd to hdd ? 
    What i have to copy ?</FONT>
<DD>A: After running 'build.bat' (WINDOWS) or 'build.sh' (UNIX) the CD isn't
    longer needed. This script converts the data on CD into our own format.
    <BR>
    A: You didn't need to copy, the installation did it for you.
<P>
<DT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">
    Q: Why did the game becomes very slow under X11?</FONT>
<DD>A: Give your X11 server a higher priority than the clients.<P>
    renice -5 &lt;pid-of-your-x11-server&gt;<P>
    newer linux distributions (debian) does this automatic.<P>
    or start freecraft with<P>
    nice -n 5 ./freecraft
<P>
<DT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Q: Can I use FreeCraft to join in an original network game?</FONT>
<DD>A: Sorry, FreeCraft use its own network protocol. You can only play
    with FreeCraft against other FreeCrafts.
<P>
<DT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Q: It is planned to support playing against the original in network game?</FONT>
<DD>A: The both network protocols are that way, that this is impossible.

<P>
<DT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Q: I only have the original BNE version, can I use it?</FONT>
<DD>A: No. Until now nobody has written a converter for this, if you want to
	write it, please contact me. It is only a question of time and you
	must understand writting C.

<P>
<DT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Q: I get only a black window, after I have installed
	it on windows. What have I done wrong?</FONT>
<DD>A: Try installing FreeCraft to C:\.

<P>
<DT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Q: Can I compile FreeCraft with VC++ or Borland C++?</FONT>
<DD>A: This C compiler aren't support yet, you can build a project and than
mail it to us.<P>

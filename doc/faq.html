<P>
<DT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Q: In 800x600 mode or higher, the graphics around the edge doesn't draw around the full screen?</FONT>
<DD>A: The original graphics aren't designed for these resolutions, you could
    design your own user interface, see "data/ccl/ui.ccl".
<P>
<DT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Q: The graphics don't fit on 800x600 or higher resolution?</FONT>
<DD>A: The original graphics aren't designed for these resolutions, you could
    design your own user interface, see "data/ccl/ui.ccl".
<P>
<DT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Q: I am getting the error "gzseek already defined or undefined!" ?</FONT>
<DD>A: You have an old version of libpng, install the libpng1.0.X or later. You get it here:
    <A HREF="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html">http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html</A>
<P>
<DT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Q: The software cursor is too slow, how can I make it faster ?</FONT>

<DD>A: We will improve the speed later, but we were told that 
on an Accelerated X server with a Pentium 75, FreeCraft is now playable.
<P>
<DT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Q: Does FreeCraft work with ALSA?</FONT>

<DD>A: Yes, FreeCraft works with the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) Driver if 
you compile FreeCraft using SDL and SDL was compiled to support ALSA (--enable-alsa).
It has been tested with versions 0.3.2 to 0.9.0.<P>
More informationcan be found here: <A HREF="http://www.alsa-project.org">

<P>
<DT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Q: How do I get big maps?</FONT>

<DD>A: If you want a map of the size 256 x 256.
Create and edit 4 maps (128 x 128) in the original editor.
Save them as bigmap1.pud, bigmap2.pud, bigmap3.pud and bigmap4.pud.
Now create a file bigmap.cm containing:
<P><PRE>
	(define-map 256 256)
	(load-pud "bigmap1.pud")
	(load-pud "bigmap2.pud")
	(load-pud "bigmap3.pud")
	(load-pud "bigmap4.pud")
</PRE><P>
Now you can load this file as a map (freecraft bigmap.cm).
bigmap1.pud is in the upper left corner.
bigmap2.pud is in the upper right corner.
bigmap3.pud is in the lower left corner.
bigmap4.pud is in the lower right corner.
<P>
CraftED - The FreeCraft map editor, also supports the creation of big maps.
<P>
<DT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Q: Can I use the original CD without expansion?</FONT>

<DD>A: Yes. Only difference is there are more graphics and sounds in the expansion CD version.
It works without problems with the german version. If you are still not sure, just try it.
It should work without problems.

<P>
<DT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Q: I have tried to start a level with
    './freecraft data/puds/internal/internal01.pud.gz' , why do I get this
    error message 'pud: fopen,gzopen,bzopen(): No such file or directory' ?
    </FONT>
<DD>A: We have changed the loading syntax:
    <UL>
    <LI>file.pud loads relative from $CLONE_LIB_PATH (in my source "data").
    <LI>./file.pud loads relative from the current directory.
    <LI>/file.pud loads absolute from the root directory.
    </UL>
    This means you must type './freecraft ./data/puds/internal/internal01.pud.gz'!
<P>
<DT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">
    Q: Why does the cursor react after several seconds when i move it?</FONT>
<DD>A: We didn't find the real problem. Currently use the threaded sound
    support and enable it (in data/ccl/sound.ccl) or add to the line
<P>
"-DSLOW_INPUT" to:
<P>
"DFLAGS= $(THREAD) $(CCL) $(VERSION) $(VIDEO) $(ZDEFS) $(DSOUND) \
	$(DEBUG)" in Rules.make
<P>
<DT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Q: I want to play without having the CD in the drive, 
can i copy files from CD to hdd ?</FONT>
<DD>A: After running 'build.bat' (WINDOWS) or 'build.sh' (UNIX) the CD is no
    longer needed. This script converts the data on CD into our own format.
    <BR>
    A: You didn't need to copy, the installation did it for you.
<P>
<DT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">
    Q: Why does the game become very slow under X11?</FONT>
<DD>A: Give your X11 server a higher priority than the clients.<P>
    renice -5 &lt;pid-of-your-x11-server&gt;<P>
    newer linux distributions (debian) does this automatically, 
    or start freecraft with<P>
    nice -n 5 ./freecraft
<P>
<DT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Q: Can I use FreeCraft to join a W*rcr*ft 2 network game?</FONT>
<DD>A: Sorry, FreeCraft use its own network protocol. You can only join 
    FreeCraft network games.
<P>
<DT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Q: Is it planned to support joining a W*rcr*ft 2 network game?</FONT>
<DD>A: Both network protocols are in such a way, that this would be impossible.

<P>
<DT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Q: I only have the original BNE version, can I use it?</FONT>
<DD>A: No. Nobody has written a converter for this, if you want to
	write it, please contact us. It is only a question of time and you
	must understand writing C.

<P>
<DT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Q: Why do I get only a black window after I installed
	it on windows?</FONT>
<DD>A: Try installing FreeCraft to C: drive.

<P>
<DT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Q: Can I compile FreeCraft with VC++?</FONT>
<DD>A: Yes. Follow the instructions in <A HREF="development.html">
development.html</A>. But mingw32 is better supported and regular tested.

<P>
<DT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Q: Can I compile FreeCraft with Borland C++?</FONT>
<DD>A: This C compiler isn't support yet, you can build a project, 
write the instrutions and than mail it to us.<P>

But you can use <A HREF="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/">cygwin</A> or
<A HREF="http://www.mingw.org">MinGW</A> both are GNU C compilers for windows.
<P>
Information on how to use MingGW and libSDL for cross development and native
development:<P>
<A HREF="http://www.libsdl.org/Xmingw32/">
http://www.libsdl.org/Xmingw32/</A><P>
Compiler package for windows built by Sam Lantinga:<P>
<A HREF="http://www.libsdl.org/Xmingw32/mingw32.zip">
http://www.libsdl.org/Xmingw32/mingw32.zip</A><P>
Based on the above this is our build. It contains SDL 1.2.4, libpng, zlib and zziplib.
Install this and download the newest FreeCraft source and start FreeCraft
development with windows:<P>

<P>
<DT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Q: What port or ports did FreeCraft use for network play?</FONT>
<DD>A: As default the only port used is 6660 UDP for both the client and server side.

<P>
<DT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Q: Why are there some grayed out fields in the FreeCraft menus?</FONT>
<DD>A: The grayed out menu entries are planned features 
which aren't finished yet. You are welcome to write them.
<P>
<DT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Q: Can I save and load a game?</FONT>
<DD>A: No. Sorry Load & Save aren't written yet.

<P>
<DT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Q: Why do I get the following compiler failure:<BR>
network.c:282: initializer element is not constant<BR>
network.c:282: (near initialization for `CommandsIn[0].first')<BR></FONT>
<DD>A: This is a bug in the GNU C Compiler 2.96, downgrade to GCC 2.95.x or
upgrade to GCC 3.xx (expect many wrong warnings). If you are using the
Redhat distribution 7.2, you can change CC=gcc to CC=kgcc in Rules.make.

<P>
<DT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Q: Can I play FreeCraft in fullscreen?</FONT>
<DD>A: Yes fullscreen is supported with SDL. <P>
In game use ALT-F or CTRL-F to switch between fullscreen and windowed mode.<P>
You can also use the commandline option -F to start the game in fullscreen
mode.<P>
You can create and edit a windows shortcut to make this the default mode.<P>
The options menu will handle this in the future.<P>

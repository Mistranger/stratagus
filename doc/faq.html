<h1>FAQ for Stratagus Version 2.1</h1>
<hr>

    <b>Q: gzseek already defined or undefined.</b><br>
    A: You have an incompatible libpng version, install the latest version.<p>

    <b>Q: .depend:1: *** missing separator.  Stop.</b><br>
    A: The .depend file is broken, simply 'rm .depend' and 'make depend' 
    again. If the problem still occurs, you will need to 'make' without 
    making dependencies first.<p>

    <b>Q: Does Stratagus work with ALSA?</b><br>
    A: Yes, if you compiled SDL with alsa support and you compiled stratagus
    using SDL video mode.<p>

    <b>Q: What ports does the Stratagus network protocol use?</b><br>
    A: Stratagus uses UDP with port 6660 by default, you may start stratagus 
    with '-Pxxxx' flag to use port xxxx instead.<p>

    <b>Q: Does stratagus support internet/metaserver play?</b><br>
    A: Not yet, but this is a planned feature and may be added for 2.2<p>

    <b>Q: I get only a black window after I have installed it on windows.
    What have I done wrong?</b><br>
    A: Install Stratagus to the C: drive. This has solved the problem for
    everybody who has had this bug.<p>

    <b>Q: Stratagus runs really slow in large resolutions, what can I do?</b><br>
    A: Versions of Stratagus from 2.1 update the screen every frame, and are
    designed to be used with OpenGL support.  Using Software/SDL to update
    large screens is too slow and will cause the game to be slow. Use
    OpenGL if possible, or play in 640x480.<p>
	
    <b>Q: I have installed the windows version, when I start Stratagus I get
    only the splash screen and the game stops, but consumes 100% CPU. What
    have I done wrong?</b><br>
    A: Please wait for a couple of minutes for the game to start. There are
    some machines (Win98 and Win2000) that will still not start after some
    time.  On all machines I have tested it, it works.  I have no idea where
    the problem is, any help is welcome.<p>

    <b>Q: Can I use Stratagus to play Age of Empires, StarCraft, or any
    other commercial game?</b><br>
    </b>A: No.<p>

    <b>Q: My question isn't answered here.</b><br>
    A: Submit a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=84903&amp;atid=574266">support tracker item</a>.<p>

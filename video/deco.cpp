/**
**		page Decorations Decorations - a mechanism for all what is on screen
**
**		This pages describes the intend to use a special mechanism that
**		functions as an intermediate between the stratagus engine and the
**		video routines.
**
**		@note It won't take away the possibility to directly draw something on
**		the screen without using this mechanism, so you have to be careful when
**		you decide to do that, as you should take care that no other object is
**		overlapping yours or you should be able to handle those overlapping
**		objects yourself.
**
**
**		@section DecoWhy Why we want 'a decoration mechanism'
**
**		This mechanism was though off, as we got some basic problems when
**		dealing with drawing everything separately from different parts of the
**		source code, details follow:
**
**		@subsection DecoP1 Problem 1: higher screen resolution support
**
**		Screen resolutions beyond 640x480 requires much memory, which also
**		costs speed performance to draw it. Not only the drawing needs to
**		write to this memory. Some what is drawn, needs to read first to
**		combine certain colors (like Fog of War).
**
**		When drawing you also need to invalidate the area you have drawn.
**		Meaning (for some video platforms, like X11) that what you draw is
**		drawn in a background buffer (a videopage) and the invalidate action
**		puts it on the screen.
**
**		Which is nice, as you can do multiple draws and invaldiate the total
**		area covered by those in one go, delivering a smoother update (as it
**		does not flicker).  But to invalidate the total buffer needs a very
**		large amount of memory to be transferred for higher screen resolutions.
**
**		So we want to minimize the access to this memory, to only update those
**		parts that have been changed, increasing the performance.
**
**		Example: before using this mechanism, we simply handled the entire main
**		map, when an unit moves from one tile to another. While we only
**		wanted the few tiles it crosses to be updated (for that unit).
**
**		@subsection DecoP2 Problem 2: unit decorations and lines
**
**		To redraw only what is needed, we need to split these areas into
**		separate rectangles. This is much faster and simpler then any other
**		variant known to me. And is also nicer, as in the end we also need to
**		invalidate rectangles areas (so we don't need to determine these twice).
**
**		Units a drawn as a sprite and so if we want to redraw the unit, we
**		need to know the rectangle region where the sprite it located and
**		redraw everythin in that.
**
**		But we also draw extra decorations near the unit (like a health bar,
**		mana and such..), these really look nice in the game. But makes it
**		harder to denote the area that needs to be redrawn, as this is no
**		longer the rectangle as is determined by the sprite. And it can
**		even change, as some decorations will only appear when the unit is
**		selected.
**
**		Currently we also support lines showing the destination/path the units
**		will follow, we want to have it divided in a lot of small rectangles,
**		as a single rectangle bounding box will cover too much of the screen
**		(so a redraw of all what is inside) and again makes the invalidate
**		slower.
**
**		@subsection DecoP3 Problem 3: overlapping units/graphics
**
**		For an update to draw some graphic, we need to know which graphics
**		are overlapping it as they also need to be redrawn. There is no link
**		available of what is located near eachother. There is a link denotihg
**		the location of the unit on the map, but what we see doesn't have to
**		be at the same location on the map.
**
**	  Example: think of a flying unit, which is not shown on the same tile
**		as a ground unit underneath, but slightly shifted.. possible one/two
**		tiles further.
**
**		So we need to denote some linkage in way that is fast and accurate in
**		determining what is overlapping and needs to be redrawn.
**
**		@subsection DecoP4 Problem 4: depth level (z-axis)
**
**		Before this mechanism we first draw the ground, then the units, then
**		the missiles and as last the fog-of-war. We also want more depth-levels
**		to be supported and let so for overlapping units/etc.. we need to
**		automaticly determine which needs to be drawn first (on given z-level).
**
**		@subsection DecoP5 Problem 5: future decorations
**
**		As we want to support all kinds of new decorations to make the
**		interface look nicer, we want a type-independent mechanism. Not as done
**		before: units/missiles/gui-buttons/.. but all of one type 'Decoration'.
**		Making the mechanism unware of what the Decoration needs to represent,
**		se we cann attach different kinds of decoratons, without having to
**		update this file and/or add new functionaility..
**
**
**		@section DecoIdeas Decoration mechanism project ideas
**
**		Ok, now to handle all those problems and most of all, be efficient
**		and fast, I have a proposal which I will describe according to the
**		following storyline delivering us the implementation issues, so you
**		can understand the reasoning behind it.
**
**		@note if you gonna change this implementation, please update this
**		storyline part and denote why things have been changed.
**
**		@subsection DecoI1 Idea 1: screentiles
**		We first need some structure of denoting what is where on the screen.
**
**		We could do that with quad-trees or some kind of mathematical way of
**		using line-equations to denote the location of each decoration, but I
**		considered these to be too slow. Also looking at the invalidate part,
**		we need to split a line up in rectangles and as each graphic is a
**		rectangle I came to the conclusion to split the screen up in multiple
**		tiles and let its decoration denote the tile(s) it is in.
**
**		@subsection DecoI2 Idea 2: 4x4 matrix in 16bit
**
**		Now we don't really need to have a direct linkage from tile to
**		decoration, as we only need to know which tiles are 'dirty', meaning
**		some graphic is updated, it marks the tiles it is covering and the
**		other Decoratons can look at their tiles to see if they need to be
**		redrawn.
**
**		As we only have 'clean' and 'dirty' tiles, I made the conclusion we can
**		use a single bit for that and save lots of memory. To enable us to
**		cover as much tiles in one integer, I use a 16bit word to denote 4x4=16
**		tiles. So to check a 4x4 tile area, only one 16bit integer is read from
**		memory.
**
**		Example: a unit covering 2x2 tiles, with the left-top tile at (5,6)
**		tiles away from the top-left of the screen. This will be at entry
**		[5/4,6/4]  in an array of 16bit integers denoting all tiles on the
**		screen. And at bit-index [5%4,6%4] in such a 16bit integer:
**		with bit-indexes:  3  2  1  0  delivers: 0000  or as hecadecimal:
**						   7  6  5  4			0000				0x6600
**						  11 10  9  8			0110
**						  15 14 13 12			0110
**
**		@subsection DecoI3 Idea 3: Minimize decorations to max 4x4 tiles
**
**		Now we still need to determine the tiles-size, but no matter what we
**		choose later on. There will always be decorations covering multiple
**		tiles. One 16bit integer denoted 4x4 tiles, but a decoration of 4x4
**		tiles will it only in a single 16bit integer when its top-left tile is
**		exactly at a 4-tile boundary. As wordt-case scenario, where the
**		top-left ia at the bottom-right of the 4x4 bitmap, it can only be 1x1
**		tile big. So we need to support decorations covering multiple 16bit
**		integers.
**
**		However I want to restrict each decoration to 2x2 16bits, as these
**		can be simply marked and checked with 4 16bit bitmasks. As the support
**		of dynamic decoration sizes requires extra while-loops and
**		if-statements to determine which 16bit entries in the array are we
**		to mark/check. I think by not using any if- or while-loop will speed
**		up performance a bit. So each decoration has 4 16bit bitmasks, the
**		left-top, right-top, left-bottom and right-bottom 4x4 bitmask.
**
**		Now in the worst-case the decoration with the lef-top tile at the
**		right-bottom bit of the left-top bitmask, will still be able to able
**		have a 5x5 tile size. And in the best-case, with the left-top tile at
**		the left-top bit of the left-top bitmaks, can handle 8x8 tiles.
**
**		But I'm not using this total freedom of beyond 4x4 tiles, as it gets
**		very inefficient to determine bits covering more then 4x4 tiles over
**		different 16bit bitmask. And altough a 4x4 tile area can also cover
**		all 4 16bit integers, I can conver this to an area within a 32bit
**		integer. The trick for this is very simple:
**
**		In example: a 3x2 tile area, with only some bits marked 'dirty', is
**		determined by the following bits in 4 16bit bitmasks.
**
**		tile-area: 00000000  delivering bitmasks: A 0000 0000 B
**				   00000000							0000 0000
**				   00000000							0000 0000
**				   00101000		A = top right			0001 0100
**				   00011000		B = left top
**				   00000000		C = right bottom  C 0001 1000 D
**				   00000000		D = left bottom			0000 0000
**				   00000000							0000 0000
**													0000 0000
**
**		Now if we combine A and C in a 32bit integer and right bit-shift with
**		the y-bit-offset of the decoration in the left-top 16bit. We can
**		put A and C in one 16bit:
**
**		(A and C) 0000 -right-shift->		0001
**				  0000						0001
**				  0000						0000
**				  0001						0000
**				  0001
**				  0000
**				  0000
**				  0000
**
**		We can do the same for B and D and combine the two resulting 16bit in
**		one 32bit, representing the 8x4 tile area in which the 'dirty' bits are:
**
**		(A and C) 0001  (B and D) 0100  as one 32bit: 00010100
**				  0001				  1000  			  00011000
**				  0000				  0000  			  00000000
**				  0000				  0000  			  00000000
**
**		Now is reasonable fast to find the bits marked 'dirty'.
**
**		@note The mechanism still supports larger Decorations though, from
**		caller point-of-view. But these are simply split up into multiple
**		ones, linking them with eachother, so the 'caller' does not have to
**		know about them.
**
**		@subsection DecoI4 Idea 4: DIRTYSCREEN_BITSIZE=16 (tile=16x16 pixels)
**
**		To denote tiles as pixels will costs too much memory and too much
**		time to maintain them. So we use tiles with a larger size to prevent
**		that, but care must be taken that we don't make them too large or we
**		let each tile overlap too many decorations and that costs unneeded
**		redraw.
**
**		Looking at this, the largest decoration as unit is currently
**		128x128 (dark portal). So if we want it to be represented as a
**		single decoration and with a maximum of 2x2 tiles, we get
**		64x64 pixels for each tile.  This is too big though, as a normal
**		ground graphic of 32x32, will already be split up in 2x2 decorations.
**
**		But if we would use a tile of 32x32, a unit crossing from one tile to
**		another, would have an overlap with four tiles at once. And as it
**		happens a lot that units go that near to eachother on a ground graphic
**		of 32x32, this would lead to a redraw of the entire ground graphic and
**		the other units overlapping this. Which would cause a chain-reaction of
**		unneeded redraws.
**
**		This overlap happens a lot, also when an unit stand stationary, its
**		decorations (healthbar,manabar,..) is drawn below it.. on a lower
**		ground tile graphic.
**
**		So I suggest to do another step back and let one tile represent 16x16
**		pixels, this will make it possible to update only on of four corners of
**		a ground graphic, so overlapping decorations on the other three corners
**		don't have to be updated.
**
**		For screen resolution 1600x1280, this will cost 100x80 tiles in
**		25x20 16bits = 1000 bytes. Which will be accessed a lot, but as its
**		that small it would be accesable from cache and not influence speed
**		that much.
**
**		@note for the assumption that a ground graphic of 32x32 pixels can be
**		put in 2x2 tiles, the main screenmap should start exactly at a tile
**		boundary.

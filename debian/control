Description: realtime strategy game for Unix and X
 Stratagus is a free cross-platform real-time strategy gaming engine.
 It includes support for playing over Internet/LAN, or playing vs.
 computer opponents. The engine is configurable and can be used to
 create games with a wide-range of features specific to your needs.
 .
 Stratagus started as a clone of the realtime fantasy strategy game
 WarCraft II from Blizzard Entertainment, although it is used now as a
 game engine to build other games, sci-fi or fantasy ones.
 .
 This is the stable release of Stratagus, and is both fairly playable and
 fairly bug-free. It also has network connectivity for up to 8 players.
 .
 Please note that you have available an OpenGL-enabled version of this
 game. Install stratagus-gl package.
 .
 This version is compiled with some of the possible options, and thus has
 gzip, bunzip2, and SDL support. The sound options will depend on your
 personal election on SDL packages.

 Please note that this is an OpenGL-enabled package. If stratagus is very
 slow is probably due to not having hardware-enabled OpenGL. Switch to
 stratagus package, built with OpenGL support disabled.

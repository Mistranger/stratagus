/**
**	@struct _player_ player.h
**
**	\#include "player.h"
**
**	typedef struct _player_ Player;
**
**	This structure contains all informations about a player in game.
**
**	The player structure members:
**
**	Player::Player
**
**		This is the unique slot number. It is not possible that two
**		players have the same slot number at the same time. The slot
**		numbers are reused in the future. This means if a player is
**		defeated, a new player can join using this slot. Currently
**		#PlayerMax (16) players are supported. This member is used to
**		access bit fields.
**		Slot #PlayerNumNeutral (15) is reserved for the neutral units
**		like gold-mines or critters.
**
**		@note Should call this member Slot?
**
**	Player::Name
**
**		Name of the player used for displays and network game.
**		It is restricted to 15 characters plus final zero.
**
**	Player::Type
**
**		Type of the player. This field is setup from the level (PUD).
**		We support currently #PlayerNeutral,
**		#PlayerNobody, #PlayerComputer, #PlayerPerson,
**		#PlayerRescuePassive and #PlayerRescueActive.
**		@see #PlayerTypes.
**
**	Player::RaceName
**
**		Name of the race to which the player belongs, used to select
**		the user interface and the AI.
**		We have 'orc', 'human', 'alliance' or 'mythical'. Should
**		only be used during configuration and not during runtime.
**
**	Player::Race
**
**		Race number of the player. This field is setup from the level
**		(PUD). This number is mapped with #RaceWcNames to the symbolic
**		name Player::RaceName.
**		@see #PlayerRaces.
**
**	Player::AiNum
**
**		AI number for computer (See #PlayerAis). This field is setup
**		from the level (PUD). Used to select the AI for the computer
**		player.
**
**	Player::Team
**
**		Team of player. Selected during network game setup. All players
**		of the same team are allied and enemy to all other teams.
**		@note It is planned to show the team on the map.
**
**	Player::Enemy
**
**		A bit field which contains the enemies of this player.
**		If Player::Enemy & (1<<Player::Player) != 0 its an enemy.
**		Setup during startup using the Player::Team, can later be
**		changed with diplomacy. Player::Enemy and Player::Allied
**		are combined, if none bit is set, the player is neutral.
**		@note You can be allied to a player, which sees you as enemy.
**
**	Player::Allied
**
**		A bit field which contains the allies of this player.
**		If Player::Allied & (1<<Player::Player) != 0 its an allied.
**		Setup during startup using the Player:Team, can later be
**		changed with diplomacy. Player::Enemy and Player::Allied
**		are combined, if none bit is set, the player is neutral.
**		@note You can be allied to a player, which sees you as enemy.
**
**	Player::X Player::Y
**
**		The tile map coordinates of the player start position. 0,0 is
**		the upper left on the map. This members are setup from the
**		level (PUD) and only important for the game start.
**		Ignored if game starts with level settings. Used to place
**		the initial workers if you play with 1 or 3 workers.
**
**	Player::Resources[::MaxCosts]
**
**		How many resources the player owns. Needed for building
**		units and structures.
**		@see _costs_, TimeCost, GoldCost, WoodCost, OilCost, MaxCosts.
**
**	Player::Incomes[::MaxCosts]
**
**		Income of the resources, when they are delivered at a store.
**		@see _costs_, TimeCost, GoldCost, WoodCost, OilCost, MaxCosts.
**
**	Player::LastResources[::MaxCosts]
**
**		Keeps track of resources in time (used for calculating
**		Player::Revenue, see below)
**
**	Player::Revenue[::MaxCosts]
**
**		Production of resources per minute (or estimates)
**              Used just as information (statistics) for the player...
**
**	Player::UnitTypesCount[::UnitTypeMax]
**
**		Total count for each different unit type. Used by the AI and
**		for dependencies checks. The addition of all counts should
**		be Player::TotalNumUnits.
**		@note Should not use the maximum number of unit-types here,
**		only the real number of unit-types used.
**
**	Player::AiEnabled
**
**		If the player is controlled by the computer and this flag is
**		true, than the player is handled by the AI on this local
**		computer.
**
**		@note Currently the AI is calculated parallel on all computers
**		in a network play. It is planned to change this.
**
**	Player::Ai
**
**		AI structure pointer. Please look at #PlayerAi for more
**		informations.
**
**	Player::Units
**
**		A table of all (Player::TotalNumUnits) units of the player.
**
**	Player::TotalNumUnits
**
**		Total number of units (incl. buildings) in the Player::Units
**		table.
**
**	Player::NumFoodUnits
**
**		Total number of units that need food, used to check food limit.
**		A player can only build up to Player::Food units and not more
**		than Player::FoodUnitLimit units.
**
**		@note that Player::NumFoodUnits > Player::Food, when enough
**		farms are destroyed.
**
**	Player::NumBuildings
**
**		Total number buildings, units that don't need food.
**
**	Player::Food
**
**		Number of food available/produced. Player can't train more
**		Player::NumFoodUnits than this.
**		@note that all limits are always checked.
**
**	Player::FoodUnitLimit
**
**		Number of food units allowed. Player can't train more
**		Player::NumFoodUnits than this.
**		@note that all limits are always checked.
**
**	Player::BuildingLimit
**
**		Number of buildings allowed.  Player can't build more
**		Player::NumBuildings than this.
**		@note that all limits are always checked.
**
**	Player::TotalUnitLimit
**
**		Number of total units allowed. Player can't have more
**		Player::NumFoodUnits+Player::NumBuildings=Player::TotalNumUnits
**		this.
**		@note that all limits are always checked.
**
**	Player::LastRepairResource
**
**		Last resource used for repair cycles. Was introduced to
**		reduce the repair speed.  @see RepairUnit.
**
**	Player::Score
**
**		Total number of points. You can get points for killing units,
**		destroying buildings ...
**
**	Player::Kills
**
**		Total number of kills.
**
**	Player::Color
**
**		Color of units of this player on the minimap. Index number
**		into the global palette.
**
**	Player::UnitColors
**
**		Unit colors of this player. Contains the hardware dependent
**		pixel values for the player colors (palette index #208-#211).
**		Setup from the global palette.
**		@note Index #208-#211 are various SHADES of the team color
**		(#208 is brightest shade, #211 is darkest shade) .... these
**		numbers are NOT red=#208, blue=#209, etc
**
**	Player::Allow
**
**		Contains which unit-types and upgrades are allowed for the
**		player. Possible values are:
**		@li	`A' -- allowed,
**		@li	`F' -- forbidden,
**		@li	`R' -- acquired, perhaps other values
**		@li	`Q' -- acquired but forbidden (does it make sense?:))
**		@li	`E' -- enabled, allowed by level but currently forbidden
**		@see _allow_
**
**	Player::UpgradeTimers
**
**		Timer for the upgrades. One timer for all possible upgrades.
**		Initial 0 counted up by the upgrade action, until it reaches
**		the upgrade time.
**		@see _upgrade_timers_
**		@note it is planned to combine research for faster upgrades.
